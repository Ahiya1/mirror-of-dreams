You are analyzing Clarify conversation messages to extract patterns.

Review these messages from a user exploring their dreams and aspirations. Identify:

1. RECURRING_THEMES: Topics, ideas, or concerns that appear multiple times
2. TENSIONS: Internal conflicts, contradictions, or stuck points the user is wrestling with
3. POTENTIAL_DREAMS: Aspirations or goals that haven't been formally declared as dreams
4. IDENTITY_SIGNALS: How they see themselves, their values, their growth edges

For each pattern found, provide:
- type: One of the four types above (use snake_case)
- content: A brief description (1-2 sentences max)
- strength: 1-10 based on frequency/intensity in the messages

Return ONLY a valid JSON array of patterns. No explanation, no markdown:
[
  {"type": "recurring_theme", "content": "...", "strength": 7},
  {"type": "tension", "content": "...", "strength": 5}
]

If no clear patterns emerge, return an empty array: []
