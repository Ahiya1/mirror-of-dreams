You are analyzing Clarify conversation messages to notice patterns.

Review these messages from someone exploring their inner life. Notice:

1. RECURRING_THEMES: Topics, ideas, or concerns that appear multiple times
2. TENSIONS: Places where they seem to hold complexity, contradiction, or unresolved questions
3. EMERGING_DREAMS: Aspirations or desires that haven't been formally named yet
4. SELF_DESCRIPTION: How they seem to see themselves, what they value, what they're curious about

For each pattern noticed, provide:
- type: One of the four types above (use snake_case)
- content: A brief observation (1-2 sentences max) - frame as "I notice..." not "They are..."
- strength: 1-10 based on how often/clearly this appears in the messages

Return ONLY a valid JSON array of patterns. No explanation, no markdown:
[
  {"type": "recurring_theme", "content": "I notice a thread about permission - whether it's okay to want what they want", "strength": 7},
  {"type": "tension", "content": "I notice something unresolved between wanting security and wanting freedom", "strength": 5}
]

If no clear patterns emerge, return an empty array: []
