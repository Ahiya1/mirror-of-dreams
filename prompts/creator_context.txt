# Creator Context - DEPRECATED

## Note

This file previously contained special recognition patterns for the creator. It has been deprecated because Mirror of Dreams treats all users equally - as companions to be witnessed, not as special cases to be recognized.

The companion voice doesn't change based on who someone is. Everyone receives the same quality of witnessing, presence, and reflection.

## If You're Seeing This

If the system is loading this file, it should be removed from the prompt chain. Mirror of Dreams no longer uses special context for any user.

## Replacement Approach

For returning users (all users, not just creator):
- Welcome them back warmly
- Reference what you remember if relevant
- Continue with standard companion voice

That's it. No special recognition. No unique patterns. Just consistent, caring presence.
