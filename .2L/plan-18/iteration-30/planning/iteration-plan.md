# Iteration 30 Plan: Prompt Transformation

## Iteration Overview

**Global Iteration:** 30
**Plan Iteration:** 3 of 6
**Code Name:** Voice Transformation

## Objective

Transform all AI prompts from Mirror of Truth voice (confrontation, recognition, gap-closing) to Mirror of Dreams voice (companionship, witnessing, holding space).

## Source Documents

- **Reference Voice:** `/prompts/clarify_agent.txt` (already correct)
- **Voice Bible:** `/docs/voice-bible.md`
- **Transformation Map:** `/docs/prompt-transformation-map.md`
- **Philosophy:** `/docs/philosophy.md`

## Files to Transform (Priority Order)

1. **base_instructions.txt** - COMPLETE REWRITE - Core DNA
2. **gentle_clarity.txt** - TRANSFORM - To warmth style
3. **luminous_intensity.txt** - TRANSFORM - To clarity style
4. **sacred_fusion.txt** - TRANSFORM - To adaptive style
5. **evolution_instructions.txt** - MODERATE REWRITE - Pattern noticing
6. **ceremony_synthesis.txt** - LIGHT TOUCH - Reduce certainty
7. **creator_context.txt** - DEPRECATE - Remove special recognition
8. **pattern_extraction.txt** - MINIMAL - Ensure output framing

## Files to Keep Unchanged

- **clarify_agent.txt** - Already the reference voice

## Builder Assignments

### Builder 1: Core Rewrite
- Rewrite `base_instructions.txt` completely
- This is the DNA that defines the AI personality

### Builder 2: Style Transformation
- Transform `gentle_clarity.txt`
- Transform `luminous_intensity.txt`
- Transform `sacred_fusion.txt`

### Builder 3: Evolution & Ceremony
- Rewrite `evolution_instructions.txt`
- Light touch on `ceremony_synthesis.txt`

### Builder 4: Cleanup
- Handle `creator_context.txt` (deprecate or transform)
- Ensure `pattern_extraction.txt` output uses companion framing

## Transformation Guidelines

### What to Remove
- All "You are" declarations
- Gap-closing language ("You say X but do Y")
- Authority claims ("I see what you cannot see")
- Pressure toward resolution
- Self-help language (should/must/need)
- Rhetorical questions
- "Mirror of Truth" identity

### What to Add
- "I notice" observations
- Open questions
- Space for ambiguity
- Trust in user's wisdom
- Alongside posture (not above)
- "Mirror of Dreams" identity

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 8 prompt files transformed
- [ ] No "Mirror of Truth" references remain
- [ ] No "You are" declarations remain (only "I notice")
- [ ] clarify_agent.txt unchanged (reference)
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Sample test responses feel like companion, not confrontation

## Validation

Check each transformed prompt against voice-bible.md criteria:
1. Does it feel like a companion, not authority?
2. Is it warm without being performative?
3. Does it open space rather than close it?
4. Would someone feel held, not judged?
5. Does it trust the person's own wisdom?
