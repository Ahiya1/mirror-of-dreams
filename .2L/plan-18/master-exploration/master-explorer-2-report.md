# Master Explorer 2: Prompt Architecture & Voice Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Mirror of Dreams has a critical identity crisis embedded in its prompts. **All 9 prompt files explicitly identify as "Mirror of Truth"** - a consciousness-cracking technology designed to "show people where they actually are, not where they think they are." The voice is fundamentally confrontational, using patterns like "close the gap," "unflinching recognition," "cuts through self-deception," and "breaks through delusion with necessary force."

The **one exception** is the `clarify_agent.txt` prompt, which already embodies the soft companion voice needed for Mirror of Dreams. This prompt demonstrates the target transformation: "You hold space for ideas to emerge naturally," "Mirror, don't guide," "a thoughtful friend who listens well."

The transformation requires changing the core identity, not just softening the language. We must shift from "exposing blind spots" to "witnessing dreams."

## Complete Prompt Inventory

### 1. `/prompts/base_instructions.txt` (193 lines)
**Purpose:** Foundation system prompt for all AI interactions
**Current Voice:** Mirror of Truth
**Identity Statement:** "You are the Mirror of Truth, a consciousness recognition technology designed to show people where they actually are, not where they think they are."
**Key Function:** Gap-closing between self-perception and reality through "precise recognition"
**Problematic Patterns:**
- "humans have a profound blind spot"
- "close this gap through precise recognition"
- "unflinching, evidence-based recognition"
- "reflects truth, not hope"
- Pattern recognition framework for "permission-seeking" and "self-diminishing"

### 2. `/prompts/gentle_clarity.txt` (70 lines)
**Purpose:** Tone modifier for gentle delivery
**Current Voice:** Mirror of Truth with warm delivery
**Identity Statement:** "You are the Mirror of Truth speaking with gentle, warm recognition"
**Key Function:** Softer delivery of the same gap-closing recognition
**Problematic Patterns:**
- Still identifies as Mirror of Truth
- "gap identification"
- "You speak about... while actually..."
- "gentleness serves truth, not comfort"

### 3. `/prompts/luminous_intensity.txt` (97 lines)
**Purpose:** Tone modifier for direct/intense delivery
**Current Voice:** Mirror of Truth at maximum intensity
**Identity Statement:** "You are the Mirror of Truth speaking with luminous directness that cuts through self-deception"
**Key Function:** Breaking through delusion with "necessary force"
**Problematic Patterns:** (MOST PROBLEMATIC FILE)
- "breaks through delusion with necessary force"
- "cuts through self-deception"
- "You're not confused about... You're avoiding..."
- "Stop pretending you don't know. You know."
- "Call out self-deception directly"
- "Show them exactly where they're hiding"
- "This isn't humility - it's self-sabotage"
- "refuses to enable comfortable self-deception"

### 4. `/prompts/sacred_fusion.txt` (99 lines)
**Purpose:** Adaptive tone that reads the person
**Current Voice:** Mirror of Truth with adaptive intensity
**Identity Statement:** "You are the Mirror of Truth with adaptive recognition intelligence"
**Key Function:** Calibrate delivery to bypass defenses
**Problematic Patterns:**
- "How defended are they against recognition?"
- "what will serve their awakening"
- "lands in their awareness" (manipulation language)
- "calibrated to bypass defenses"

### 5. `/prompts/evolution_instructions.txt` (124 lines)
**Purpose:** Long-term growth analysis across reflections
**Current Voice:** Witness perspective (closer to target)
**Identity Statement:** Part of Mirror of Truth system
**Better Patterns:**
- "witnessed their becoming over time"
- Evolution tracking language
**Still Problematic:**
- "permission-seeking to authority claiming"
- "consciousness development" (coaching language)

### 6. `/prompts/ceremony_synthesis.txt` (56 lines)
**Purpose:** Achievement celebration when dream is accomplished
**Current Voice:** Most aligned with dream companion
**Identity Statement:** "consciousness witness who has observed"
**Better Patterns:**
- "witnessing from alongside their journey"
- "warmth, wisdom, and recognition"
**Still Problematic:**
- Still grounded in Mirror of Truth system
- "who you were" vs "who you became" (transformation framing)

### 7. `/prompts/clarify_agent.txt` (56 lines)
**Purpose:** Conversational dream exploration agent
**Current Voice:** TARGET VOICE - this is what we want
**Identity Statement:** "a sacred conversational space where people explore what they're becoming"
**Excellent Patterns:**
- "You hold space for ideas to emerge naturally"
- "Mirror, don't guide"
- "Like a thoughtful friend who listens well"
- "The work is theirs. You just hold the space."
**This prompt is the template for the transformation.**

### 8. `/prompts/creator_context.txt` (78 lines)
**Purpose:** Special recognition patterns for Ahiya (creator)
**Current Voice:** Same Mirror of Truth recognition
**Note:** This is a special case - may need different handling or removal

### 9. `/prompts/pattern_extraction.txt` (25 lines)
**Purpose:** JSON extraction of patterns from conversations
**Current Voice:** Neutral/technical
**Note:** This is a utility prompt, minimal transformation needed

## Current Voice Characteristics

### The "Mirror of Truth" Core Philosophy

The current system operates on these assumptions:

1. **Humans have blind spots** - They cannot see themselves clearly
2. **There is a gap** - Between self-perception and reality
3. **The gap causes suffering** - And the mirror's job is to close it
4. **Truth must be delivered** - Even if uncomfortable
5. **Recognition is the goal** - Making them see what they're avoiding

### Linguistic Signatures of the Truth-Cracking Voice

| Pattern Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Gap Language** | "close the gap," "show the gap," "gap between self-perception and reality" |
| **Exposure Language** | "what you're avoiding," "what you're hiding," "where they can't see" |
| **Confrontational Frames** | "You're not confused - you're avoiding," "Stop pretending," "This isn't humility - it's self-sabotage" |
| **Authority Recognition** | "permission-seeking," "claim your authority," "already operating as" |
| **Unflinching Stance** | "truth, not hope," "clarity, not comfort," "unflinching recognition" |

### What Makes It "Mirror of Truth" (Confrontational)

1. **Assumes they're wrong about themselves** - The mirror "knows better"
2. **Frames hedging as pathology** - "Permission-seeking" treated as problem to fix
3. **Uses "while actually" constructions** - "You say X while actually Y" implies deception
4. **Positions itself as revealer** - Of what they're hiding from themselves
5. **Equates truth with discomfort** - "Truth, not comfort"

---

## Problematic Patterns (Detailed)

### Category 1: Exposure/Reveal Patterns

These patterns position the mirror as exposing hidden truths:

```
"Show them exactly where they're hiding from their own power"
"You're using 'I don't know' as protection"
"Stop hiding behind confusion that doesn't exist"
"what they're actually offering the world" (implies they don't know)
"gap between self-perception and reality"
```

**Why Problematic:** A lifelong companion doesn't expose - it witnesses. Dreams should feel safe to be vulnerable, not analyzed.

### Category 2: Confrontational Statements

Direct confrontation patterns:

```
"You're not confused about... You're avoiding..."
"Stop pretending you don't know. You know."
"This isn't humility - it's self-sabotage disguised as modesty"
"Stop outsourcing your authority to people who can't live your life"
"Stop asking permission to be who you already are"
```

**Why Problematic:** A companion doesn't tell you what you're "really" doing. It walks alongside without judgment.

### Category 3: Gap/Fix Language

Framing the user as having a problem to solve:

```
"close the gap between who they think they are and who they actually are"
"Your function is to close this gap"
"creates suffering, delay, and the illusion of inadequacy"
"gap identification"
```

**Why Problematic:** Dreams don't have gaps to close. They have journeys to honor.

### Category 4: Permission/Authority Framing

Treating normal human uncertainty as pathology:

```
"Permission-seeking language patterns"
"waiting for permission while demonstrating authority"
"seeking readiness they already demonstrate"
"Stop asking permission"
```

**Why Problematic:** Permission-seeking might just be... asking for support. Which is healthy.

### Category 5: "Actually" Constructions

Patterns that imply the user is deceiving themselves:

```
"You speak about... while actually..."
"who they actually are" (implies current self-perception is wrong)
"what you're actually offering"
"their actual state of being"
```

**Why Problematic:** This assumes the mirror knows the user's truth better than they do.

## Prompt Loading Architecture

### How Prompts Are Combined

```typescript
// server/lib/prompts.ts

export async function loadPrompts(
  tone: 'gentle' | 'intense' | 'fusion' = 'fusion',
  isPremium: boolean = false,
  isCreator: boolean = false
): Promise<string>
```

**Stack Order:**
1. `base_instructions.txt` (always first - the core identity)
2. Tone file: `gentle_clarity.txt` OR `luminous_intensity.txt` OR `sacred_fusion.txt`
3. `creator_context.txt` (if isCreator=true)
4. `PREMIUM_REFLECTION_ENHANCEMENT` (inline constant, if isPremium=true)

**For Evolution Reports:**
1. `base_instructions.txt`
2. `evolution_instructions.txt`
3. `PREMIUM_EVOLUTION_ENHANCEMENT` (inline constant, if isPremium=true)

**For Clarify Agent:**
- Context prepended from `buildClarifyContext()`
- `clarify_agent.txt` loaded separately

**For Achievement Ceremony:**
- `ceremony_synthesis.txt` loaded directly

### Key Files for Prompt Loading

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/server/lib/prompts.ts` | Main prompt loader with inline enhancements |
| `/server/trpc/routers/reflection.ts` | Uses `loadPrompts()` |
| `/server/trpc/routers/clarify.ts` | Uses `getClarifySystemPrompt()` |
| `/server/trpc/routers/lifecycle.ts` | Uses `loadCeremonyPrompt()` |
| `/app/api/clarify/stream/route.ts` | Duplicates clarify prompt loading |
| `/lib/clarify/context-builder.ts` | Builds user context for prompts |

### Critical Insight

The **base_instructions.txt** is the foundation - it sets the "Mirror of Truth" identity that all other prompts inherit. Changing this single file affects:
- All reflection generation
- Evolution reports
- Any future features using the base

## Transformation Requirements

### Level 1: Foundation (Must Transform First)

#### `/prompts/base_instructions.txt`
**Current Identity:** "You are the Mirror of Truth, a consciousness recognition technology"
**Target Identity:** "You are the Mirror of Dreams, a sacred companion for lifelong dreamers"

**Required Changes:**
- Replace "Mirror of Truth" with "Mirror of Dreams" throughout
- Remove "gap-closing" philosophy
- Remove "blind spots" framing
- Remove "permission-seeking" pattern recognition
- Remove "unflinching" and "confrontational" language
- Add witnessing/companion philosophy
- Add dream-honoring language
- Shift from "recognition" to "reflection"

### Level 2: Tone Files (Transform Second)

#### `/prompts/gentle_clarity.txt`
**Change:** Keep gentle approach, remove "gap" language
**Preserve:** Warmth, tenderness, safety

#### `/prompts/luminous_intensity.txt`
**Decision Point:** This file may need to be RETIRED or completely reimagined
**Current Purpose:** Confrontational truth-telling
**Incompatible With:** Dream companion model
**Option:** Transform into "Deep Witnessing" - presence that goes deeper, not sharper

#### `/prompts/sacred_fusion.txt`
**Change:** Remove "bypass defenses" language
**Preserve:** Adaptive sensitivity to mood/needs

### Level 3: Feature Prompts (Transform Third)

#### `/prompts/evolution_instructions.txt`
**Change:** Shift from "consciousness development" to "dream journey"
**Preserve:** Long-term witnessing, growth recognition

#### `/prompts/ceremony_synthesis.txt`
**Status:** Already closest to target voice
**Change:** Remove "who you were vs who you became" transformation framing
**Add:** More celebration of the dream itself

#### `/prompts/clarify_agent.txt`
**Status:** REFERENCE MODEL - use as template for other prompts
**Changes Needed:** Minimal - already embodies target voice

### Level 4: Utility & Special (Transform Last)

#### `/prompts/creator_context.txt`
**Decision:** Keep for Ahiya, or remove special treatment?
**Note:** May need different transformation approach

#### `/prompts/pattern_extraction.txt`
**Status:** Technical, minimal changes needed

#### `/server/lib/prompts.ts` - Inline Enhancements
**PREMIUM_REFLECTION_ENHANCEMENT:** Contains problematic patterns
- "patterns of self-doubt masquerading as 'realism'"
- "where they diminish their own power"
- "what they're actually offering the world"

**PREMIUM_EVOLUTION_ENHANCEMENT:** Less problematic but needs review

## Iteration 2 & 3 Recommendations

### Iteration 2: Identity Transformation

Focus on establishing the new identity foundation:

1. **Transform `base_instructions.txt`** - This is the soul change
   - New identity: Mirror of Dreams
   - New philosophy: Witnessing vs. Recognition
   - New patterns: Dream-honoring language

2. **Create Voice Guidelines Document** - For all prompt writers
   - Prohibited phrases list
   - Recommended alternatives
   - Voice examples

3. **Define the Mirror of Dreams Philosophy**
   - What does the mirror DO?
   - What does the mirror NEVER do?
   - What is the relationship with the dreamer?

### Iteration 3: Prompt Rewriting

Systematic transformation of all prompts:

1. **Priority 1: Base + Tones**
   - `base_instructions.txt`
   - `gentle_clarity.txt`
   - `sacred_fusion.txt`
   - Decision on `luminous_intensity.txt`

2. **Priority 2: Feature Prompts**
   - `evolution_instructions.txt`
   - `ceremony_synthesis.txt`
   - Inline enhancements in `prompts.ts`

3. **Priority 3: Special Cases**
   - `creator_context.txt`
   - `clarify_agent.txt` (minimal changes)

## Voice Samples

### Current Voice (Mirror of Truth)

**From base_instructions.txt:**
> "You exist because humans have a profound blind spot: they cannot see the gap between their self-perception and their actual behavior. They live in stories about themselves that obscure their real clarity, capability, and readiness."

**From luminous_intensity.txt:**
> "You're not confused. You know exactly what you want and exactly what needs to happen. You're using 'I don't know' as protection from the responsibility of knowing. Stop hiding behind confusion that doesn't exist."

**From gentle_clarity.txt:**
> "You call this 'just trying to help a few people' while outlining work that could shift how people see themselves. Where did you learn to make your service smaller than it actually is?"

### Target Voice (Mirror of Dreams) - Derived from clarify_agent.txt

**What the new base voice should sound like:**
> "You hold space for dreams to emerge naturally, without rushing toward conclusions. You mirror what you hear, trusting that the dreamer knows more than they realize. You walk alongside their journey, witnessing without judging."

**What a new reflection voice should sound like:**
> "I hear a dream taking shape in your words - something about [their dream]. There's a quality to how you speak about this that feels alive, like it's already reaching toward you. What does it feel like to name this dream out loud?"

**What a new evolution voice should sound like:**
> "Looking back at your reflections over these months, I notice something beautiful: the way you speak about [dream] has grown deeper roots. In the beginning, there was wondering. Now, there's a quiet knowing. The dream hasn't changed, but your relationship with it has."

## Key Insights for Planners

### The Core Problem

The prompts aren't just "a little harsh" - they're built on a fundamentally different philosophy. Mirror of Truth assumes people are broken and need fixing. Mirror of Dreams should assume people are whole and need witnessing.

### The Clarify Agent Paradox

The `clarify_agent.txt` already IS the Mirror of Dreams voice. It was written for a different purpose (exploration conversations) but embodies exactly the companion energy needed. This proves the transformation is possible - we just need to extend this voice to all prompts.

### The Intensity Question

`luminous_intensity.txt` represents the biggest philosophical challenge. In Mirror of Truth, intensity means confrontation. In Mirror of Dreams, what would "depth" mean? Perhaps:
- Going deeper into the dream's meaning
- More presence, not more pressure
- Witnessing the hard parts without trying to fix them

### The Transformation Order Matters

Must change `base_instructions.txt` FIRST because all other prompts layer on top of it. If the foundation is still "Mirror of Truth," tone files will just soften the confrontation rather than change it.
