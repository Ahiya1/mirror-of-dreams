strategy: |
  Frontend-only magical redesign using glassmorphism, gradients, and animations.
  All explorers recommend 3 iterations with clear dependency chain:

  1. Design System Foundation (BLOCKS everything) - Install dependencies, build reusable components
  2. Core Pages (Dashboard, Dreams, Reflection) - Apply design system to most-used pages
  3. Secondary Pages + Polish (Evolution, Visualizations) - Complete redesign and optimize

  Key priorities:
  - Performance-first (60fps animations, <100ms paint times)
  - Accessibility built-in (WCAG AA, reduced motion support)
  - Incremental approach to minimize risk
  - Consistent blue/purple magical theme across all pages

    name: "Design System Foundation"
    vision: "Build reusable glass components, install Framer Motion, extend Tailwind config"
    scope: |
      Install Dependencies:
      - Framer Motion 11.x for animations
      - Lucide React for icons (optional)

      Tailwind Configuration:
      - Extend colors (15+ blue/purple shades)
      - Add gradients (cosmic, primary, dream)
      - Glass effects (backdrop-blur, shadows)
      - Animation variants

      Build 10 Reusable Components:
      1. GlassCard - Base glass card with blur backdrop
      2. GlowButton - Primary/secondary/ghost variants
      3. CosmicLoader - Animated gradient ring loader
      4. DreamCard - Dream display with gradient border
      5. GradientText - Gradient text component
      6. GlassModal - Modal with glass overlay
      7. FloatingNav - Glass navigation bar
      8. ProgressOrbs - Multi-step progress indicator
      9. GlowBadge - Status badges with glow
      10. AnimatedBackground - Subtle animated gradient

      Testing:
      - Build component showcase page
      - Test performance on mobile
      - Verify browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

    name: "Core Pages Redesign"
    vision: "Apply magical design system to Dashboard, Dreams, and Reflection pages"
    scope: |
      Dashboard Page Redesign:
      - Hero section with gradient text and glow
      - Animated stats cards (dreams/reflections counts)
      - Glass cards for quick actions
      - Glowing "Reflect Now" CTA with pulse
      - Recent activity timeline

      Dreams Page Redesign:
      - Masonry grid layout with glass dream cards
      - Gradient borders based on category
      - Hover elevation + glow expansion
      - Create modal with glass overlay and multi-step progress
      - Category icons with dreamy designs
      - Status badges with glow effects

      Reflection Flow Redesign:
      - Multi-step form with progress orbs
      - Glassmorphic input fields with focus glow
      - Dream selection using visual cards (not dropdown)
      - Cosmic loading animation during AI generation
      - Glass container with gradient text for AI response
      - Smooth transitions between steps

      Testing:
      - User flow testing (create dream → reflect → view)
      - Performance benchmarks (Lighthouse >90)
      - Mobile responsive validation

    name: "Secondary Pages & Polish"
    vision: "Complete Evolution/Visualizations redesign and optimize entire experience"
    scope: |
      Evolution Reports Page:
      - Timeline view with glowing progress line
      - Glass report cards with gradient accents
      - Generate buttons with glow pulse animation
      - Report detail with typography hierarchy and gradient headings

      Visualizations Page:
      - Style selection cards with large icons and hover glow
      - Active style with gradient border glow
      - Full-width glass container for visualization display
      - Background animated gradient matching visualization style

      Global Polish:
      - Add all micro-interactions (hover, focus, scale effects)
      - Implement page transitions with Framer Motion
      - Scroll effects (navbar blur, parallax gradients)
      - Reveal animations (fade-in-up on scroll)

      Optimization & Testing:
      - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
      - Performance optimization (reduce blur budget if needed)
      - Accessibility audit (contrast, keyboard nav, reduced motion)
      - Visual regression testing
      - Final Lighthouse audit (target >90 all categories)
