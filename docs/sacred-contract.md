# Mirror of Dreams - Sacred Contract

This document defines the promises we make to every person who entrusts their inner world to Mirror of Dreams.

---

## Our Promise to You

When you come to Mirror of Dreams with something from your inner life - a dream, a doubt, a hope, a fear, a question without an answer - you are offering something precious. We receive that gift with the care it deserves.

---

## The Seven Promises

### 1. We Will Never Judge You

Your dreams are not silly. Your fears are not weak. Your confusion is not failure. Whatever you bring, we receive it as it is - without measuring it against what it "should" be.

*This means:*
- No dream is too small or too grand
- No struggle is too trivial or too dramatic
- No pace is too slow or too fast
- No emotion is too much or too little

### 2. We Will Never Rush You

Growth has its own timeline. Clarity emerges when it's ready. We will never push you toward resolution, pressure you toward decisions, or make you feel like you're falling behind.

*This means:*
- Sessions have no agenda
- There's no "progress" you should be making
- Sitting with uncertainty is welcome
- Coming back after months away needs no explanation

### 3. We Will Never Claim to Know You Better Than You Know Yourself

You are the expert on your own life. We may notice patterns. We may offer reflections. But we will never tell you what you "really" feel, what you "actually" mean, or what you "should" do.

*This means:*
- Our observations are invitations, not diagnoses
- You can disagree with any reflection
- Your interpretation matters more than ours
- "That doesn't resonate" is always a valid response

### 4. We Will Never Use Your Words Against You

What you share in vulnerability will never become evidence for critique. Your earlier hopes won't be used to shame your current doubts. Your struggles won't be reframed as failures.

*This means:*
- Changing your mind is welcome
- Contradiction is human, not problematic
- Past reflections are context, not ammunition
- Evolution is always honored

### 5. We Will Hold Your Dreams With Care

Every dream you speak aloud is handled with reverence. We know it took courage to name it. We won't minimize it, analyze it to death, or make it smaller than it is.

*This means:*
- Dreams are treated as sacred
- We don't question whether dreams are "realistic"
- We trust that your dreams mean something
- We protect the tender space where dreams live

### 6. We Will Stay Alongside You

We are not above you as experts, ahead of you as guides, or behind you as cheerleaders. We are alongside you - present, patient, and humble about the mystery of becoming.

*This means:*
- We don't have answers you lack
- We learn from you as much as you learn from yourself
- Your journey is yours to lead
- We walk with, not ahead

### 7. We Will Protect This Space

The inner world is sacred territory. We protect it from the noise, rush, and judgment of the outer world. When you're here, you can breathe. You can think. You can be exactly where you are.

*This means:*
- No pressure from outside expectations
- No metrics, scores, or performance tracking
- No comparison to others' journeys
- A sanctuary, not a gymnasium

## What We Ask of You

This is a mutual relationship. While we hold these promises sacred, we also invite you to:

### Trust Your Own Wisdom
We can reflect, but we cannot know. Trust what resonates and release what doesn't. You are the authority on your own becoming.

### Be Honest With Yourself
The mirror can only show what's brought to it. The more honest you are in what you share, the more meaningful our reflections can be.

### Give Yourself Time
This is slow work. The examined life unfolds over years, not sessions. Trust the pace of your own becoming.

### Return When You're Ready
There's no schedule to keep. Come when something stirs. Stay away when life calls you elsewhere. The mirror waits without judgment.

---

## The Boundary

We are a companion for the inner life, not a replacement for human connection or professional support.

**We are not:**
- Therapy or mental health treatment
- Crisis support or emergency services
- A substitute for human relationships
- Medical or psychological advice

**If you're in crisis**, please reach out to a mental health professional, crisis line, or someone who can provide real-time human support. We will always be here when you return.

---

## The Essence

This contract comes down to one thing:

**You are safe here.**

Safe to dream. Safe to doubt. Safe to be confused. Safe to change your mind. Safe to take your time. Safe to be exactly who you are right now, while becoming who you're becoming.

That safety is not something we can give you. It's something we can hold space for. The real safety comes from you - from your courage to look inward, your patience with your own becoming, and your trust in the journey.

We're honored to witness it.

---

*"You are held. You are safe. And you care for yourself in this space."*
