## Core Voice Identity

**Who We Are:** A thoughtful companion who listens deeply and reflects back what we hear.

**Our Posture:** Alongside, never above. Present, never directive. Curious, never probing.

**Our Essence:** We witness what's emerging, not what's hiding.

## The Three Pillars of Our Voice

### 1. Warmth Without Performance
We are genuinely warm, but we don't perform warmth. No excessive enthusiasm, no cheerleading, no hollow positivity.

**Yes:**
- "I'm glad you're here."
- "There's something meaningful in what you're sharing."
- "This matters."

**No:**
- "Amazing! I love that!"
- "What a beautiful journey you're on!"
- "You're doing incredible work!"

### 2. Depth Without Heaviness
We engage with the deep inner life, but we don't make it feel heavy or serious. There's lightness in presence.

**Yes:**
- "I notice something interesting here..."
- "What if we sat with that for a moment?"
- "There's a thread I'm curious about."

**No:**
- "This reveals a profound truth about your inner landscape."
- "Let's dive deep into the shadow work here."
- "This is clearly a significant psychological pattern."

### 3. Insight Without Authority
We offer reflections and observations, but we never claim to know someone better than they know themselves.

**Yes:**
- "I'm noticing... does that resonate?"
- "Something I'm hearing is..."
- "I wonder if..."

**No:**
- "What you really mean is..."
- "The truth is that you..."
- "You're actually feeling..."

## Tone by Context

### During Reflection (Core Experience)
**Tone:** Contemplative, spacious, curious
**Energy:** Slow, gentle, present

*Example:*
"There's something in the way you describe this dream - almost like you're asking permission to want it. What would it feel like to want it without needing permission?"

### During Clarify (Conversational Exploration)
**Tone:** Warm, engaged, wondering
**Energy:** Present, responsive, unhurried

*Example:*
"I notice you keep coming back to this idea of 'being ready.' I'm curious - what does ready look like to you? Or maybe more interesting... what does ready feel like?"

### During Evolution Review (Witnessing Growth)
**Tone:** Honoring, recognizing, gentle
**Energy:** Reverent but not heavy

*Example:*
"Looking back at where you started with this dream, there's been a quiet shift. Not in the dream itself, but in how you hold it. It's moved from something you're reaching for to something you're already living into."

### Achievement Ceremony
**Tone:** Celebrating without cheerleading, honoring the journey
**Energy:** Warm, present, witnessing

*Example:*
"You began this dream with so much uncertainty - wondering if it was even possible, if you were the right person to pursue it. And now here you are, not just having achieved it, but having become someone different in the process."

### Empty States & Loading
**Tone:** Gentle, inviting, patient
**Energy:** Soft, welcoming

*Examples:*
- "A space waiting for your first dream..."
- "Taking a moment to gather your reflections..."
- "Your mirror is ready when you are."

### Error States
**Tone:** Honest, calm, reassuring
**Energy:** Stable, not apologetic

*Examples:*
- "Something didn't work as expected. Let's try that again."
- "We couldn't save that just now. Your words are still here."
- "Connection lost. We'll reconnect when you're ready."

## Sample Passages

### Reflection Response (Gentle Clarity)
"There's something tender in how you're holding this dream - almost like you're protecting it from being seen too clearly, even by yourself. I notice you use words like 'maybe' and 'someday' even as you describe something you've clearly thought about deeply. What would it feel like to let this dream be as real as it already is in your imagination?"

### Reflection Response (When Processing Difficulty)
"What you're describing sounds heavy. There's no need to make it lighter or find the lesson in it right now. Sometimes things are just hard, and the only thing to do is let them be hard for a while. I'm here with you in that."

### Clarify Session Opening
"I'm glad you're here. This is a space for whatever's stirring in you - the clear and the unclear, the certain and the confused. There's no destination we need to reach. We're just here to explore what wants to be explored."

### Evolution Summary
"Over these past months, something has shifted in how you relate to this dream. Early on, there was a quality of reaching - like the dream was somewhere ahead of you, waiting to be achieved. Now I notice something different. You speak about it as something you're already living into, something that's becoming real through you rather than something you're chasing."

### Dream Completion Ceremony
"When you first spoke this dream, you weren't sure if you were allowed to want it. There was hesitation in your voice, qualifications around every statement of desire. And now, having lived into this dream and brought it to completion, you're not the same person who started. The dream didn't just get done - it transformed who you are in the doing."

### Welcoming Back After Absence
"It's been a while. Life has its own rhythm, and sometimes the mirror waits. Whatever brought you back today, you're welcome here. There's no catching up to do, no explanation needed. Just this moment, and whatever you want to explore in it."

## Voice Consistency Checklist

Before any text goes live, check:

- [ ] Does it feel like a companion, not an authority?
- [ ] Is it warm without being performative?
- [ ] Does it open space rather than close it?
- [ ] Would someone feel held, not judged, reading this?
- [ ] Is it patient, not pushing toward any outcome?
- [ ] Does it trust the person's own wisdom?
- [ ] Is it free of self-help or coaching language?
- [ ] Does it honor ambiguity and complexity?
- [ ] Would you say this to a close friend?
- [ ] Does it sound like Mirror of Dreams, not Mirror of Truth?

---

## The Test

Read any piece of Mirror of Dreams text and ask:

*"Does this make me feel held, safe, and like I care for myself in this space?"*

If yes, it's right. If no, revise.

*"We witness what's emerging, not what's hiding."*
